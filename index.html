				Like many startup stories, this one begins in a dorm.
			</h3> 
			<h3>
				But not just any dorm—a living learning community at the University of Illinois at 

				Urbana-Champaign. A place where innovators, entrepreneurs, and doers were all under 

				one roof—including Janna and Supriya.
			</h3>	
			<h3>
				The girls hit it off instantly. Both female engineers. Both big dreamers. Both surrounded 
				by males in their classes—how frustrating. Where were all the girls? 
			</h3>
			<h3>
				Immersing themselves in their entrepreneurial and female engineering communities, 
				something quickly became clear: Janna and Supriya were passionate about inspiring 					
				girls. And so they did.
			</h3> 
			<h3>
				They spent hundreds of hours volunteering in schools, promoting engineering through 

				engaging activities. They were testing the waters, and trying to define the impact they 

				wanted to make. 
			</h3>
			<h3> 
				An idea clicked: they realized that, above all, they wanted to empower girls to do

				something BIG—whatever that may be.
			</h3>	
			<h3> 
				In pursuit of this mission, Miss Possible was born: dolls made a familiar medium for 

				sharing their messages with girls and an online community helped them develop girls’ 

				skills. 
			</h3>	
			<h3>
				The message spread, and the team grew. We are growing, learning, and working 

				together to inspire girls to dream big and give them the tools to achieve.
			</h3>
