				Miss Possible knows that girls can change the world, and we want to help them get there!
					<br>
					<br>
				We are designing dolls that represent real women who made a difference. With their dolls, girls get access to our online games and other content to help them build skills while having fun! Give a girl a Miss Possible doll and she gets a great toy and a strong role model. She learns the story of a women who accomplished amazing things, and was once a girl just like her.
